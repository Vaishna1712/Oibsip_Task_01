Title: Iris Flower Classification

Description: This project is an implementation of a machine learning model to classify iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset used for this project is the Iris Dataset, which is a commonly used dataset for machine learning and data analysis.

The repository includes the following files:

iris.ipynb: a Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation iris.csv: the Iris Dataset used for this project README.md: a detailed documentation of the project and its objectives

This project is a great starting point for anyone interested in machine learning and classification problems, as well as for those who want to learn how to work with Jupyter notebooks and GitHub
